# Asteroid_game

"Build a clone of the classic Asteroids game using Pygame and object-oriented programming concepts. This guided project will help you understand how to use Pygame to create a game loop, handle user input, and manage game state. You'll also learn how to use object-oriented programming to create game objects and manage their interactions." --> Boot.dev

I had a great time working on this project! Here are some key concepts that were introduced and enforced:

- **Multi-file Python Project:** Utilized object-oriented programming (OOP) and imported custom classes from different files.
- **Python Virtual Environment:** Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- **Pygame Library:** Worked with Pygame, a non-default Python library for game development.

## Game Development Concepts :video_game:

These concepts transformed my understanding of video games and demystified the game development process for me:

- **Game Loop:** The core structure for running a game continuously.
- **FPS and Delta Time:** Learned how frame rate and time per frame impact game performance.
- **Game Sprites:** Implemented visual elements for characters and objects.
- **Game Object Movement:** Developed mechanics for how objects move within the game.
- **Pygame Groups/Containers:** Organized game objects for efficient management.
- **Collision Detection:** Implemented systems to manage interactions between objects. :collision:
- **Mathematics:** Discovered how essential math is for game development, from physics calculations to understanding transformations and movement. It really highlighted the importance of mathematical concepts in creating engaging gameplay.

**This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for game design!**

### Side Quests: :metal:

The course also offered a list of challenges for those eager to dive deeper, and Iâ€™m excited to tackle these in the future!

- Add a scoring system :white_check_mark: !
- Implement multiple lives and respawning :white_check_mark:
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids :white_check_mark:
- Add acceleration to the player movement :white_check_mark:
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
